Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure as a code (IaC) tool that allows you to build,change, and version infrastructure
safely and efficiently.

Terraform components

1. Providers ->
Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with cloud providers, SaaS
providers, and other APIS.

2. Resources -> Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks,
compute instances, or hihger-leve components such as DNS records.

3. Variables -> Using variables in terraform configurations makes our deployment more dynamic.
A seperate file with name "variables.tf" needs to be created in the working directory to store all variables
for our used in main.tf configuration file.

4. Statefile -> After the deployment is finished terraform creates a state file to keep track of our current state of the infrastructure.
It will use this file to compare when you deploy/destroy resources, in the other words it compares "current state"
with "desired state" using this file.

A file with a name of "terraform.tfstate" will be created in your working directory.

5. Provisioners -> Provisioners provide the ability to run additional steps or tasks when a 
resource is created or destroyed.
