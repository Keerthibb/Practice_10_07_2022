Listing & Manging process 

---> Running state :- The process is either running or its ready to run.

---> Waiting state :- The process is waiting for an event or for a resource (resource :"CPU or Memory)
                      (It's not running still it is in queue).

                                  __ 1) Interuptable process :- Interuptable process can be interuptted by signal 
                 Waiting state --|              
                                 |__ 2) Uninteruptable process :- Uninteruptted waiting process are waiting directly on hardware condition and cannot be interuptted under any circumstances.


---> Stopped state :- The process has been stopped, usually receiveing a stop signal.

---> Orphaned state :- If a process exists with children still running, those are are orphans (doesn't harm )

---> Zombie process :- This is halted process which, for some resaon, still has a task_struct data structure in the task vector.
                       (Ex : The process has been died but it is not exist from the process table and it will not run other process also)
                       There is no command to kill the zombie process.
                       Also we can't kill those zombie process so inorder to fix this, server should be reboot and to clear the zombie process. 
                       Zombie process are very dangerous, when we allocate the resource :"CPU or Memory".
                       Whenever the big processes which is continuosly running on our machine suddenly struck with up our whatever the Memory or CPU utilisation allocated to that process,
                       the major CPU or Memory threats it holds and doesn't give you the other resources to run smoothly. it leads performance issues.

To check the zombie process

keerthi@Ubuntu-K:~$ ps -aux | grep Z  or ps -aux | egrep "Z|defunct" also we can check using top command.

USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
keerthi    11058  0.0  0.1   9672  2232 ?        S    21:17   0:00 sadc 1 61 -Z -S A_NULL A_MEMORY
keerthi    11100  0.0  0.0   8908   724 pts/0    S+   21:17   0:00 grep --color=auto Z

{Any process stat Z which means that zombie or died process} for ex : STAT S and S+

Using the above command, We have to check the first process id of the zombie , later we need to check the zombie parent process using the first zombie id.

--->  ps -o ppid= -p 5592 or ps -o ppid= 5592 {5592 is the child process id}.

---> Kill -9 zombie parent process id.

To sort out the process of high utilization for CPU and Memory.

ps -aux --sort=-pcpu,+pmem

 ps -e -o pid,uname,pcpu,pmem,comm

To bring back to foreground {fg command}

jobs or jobs -l

fg %3  [3 is the background process number not id.
