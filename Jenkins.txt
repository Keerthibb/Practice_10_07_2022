############################### Upstream and Downstream Jobs #######################################

Paremerterized plugin
Build pipeline

Running the Jenkins job one after one
-> Relationship b/n the jobs
Build, Test, Deployment, Regression

# Adavantages of Parameter
You don't have to hardcode anything, suppose if you want run any job you can just change or add the parameter

We can re-arrange the parameters

Linux:- $(PARAMETER_NAME)
Windows:- %PARAMETER_NAME%


===========================> Jenkins Pipeline

Simple words - Series or collection of Job or events which are linked with each other in sequence
which will help to build CI and CD.

Technical words - Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating
continuous delivery pipelines into jenkins.

Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for building simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code"
with the help of the pipeline.

What is Jenkins Pipeline

What is Jenkins file

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file(called a Jenkinsfile)

Advantages of the pipeline, if one of the stage is failed it will not go to next phase

We can write the jenkins file in a two way

1. Declarative way
2. Scripted way

#######################################>  Master and Slave

-> What is the problem statement with current approach

-> What is Jenkins Master and Slave architecture

-> Setup slave(Windows) without tool

-> Setup slave(windows) with tools(Java, Maven, Git)


Problem statement

It is not recommended to run all Jenkins job in master

===================================> Job schedule through crontab, polling

=> Automatically Trigger Jenkins Jobs Using Github WebHook | Jenkins Integration With Github Webhook

=> How To Run Jenkins Job Periodically | Run Jenkins Job Every 5 Minutes |2 hours | Poll SCM In Jenkins

-> Cron patterns

Based on the job schedule it will keep on checking and updating the job

-> Polling
Based on the poll it will if there is anything changes have been done on the github
