1)We will start by using the traditional date command to find out present timezone as follows:

$ date
Alternatively, type the command below, where %Z format prints the alphabetic timezone and %z prints the numeric timezone:

$ date +"%Z %z"

2. Next, you can likewise use timedatectl, when you run it without any options, the command displays an overview of the system including the timezone like so:

$ timedatectl ---> Use full command

More so, try to employ a pipeline and grep command to only filter the timezone as below:

$ timedatectl | grep “Time zone”

3) In addition, users of Debian and its derivatives can display the content of the file /etc/timezone using cat utility to check your timezone:

$ cat /etc/timezone
