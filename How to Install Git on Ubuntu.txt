Start by updating the package index:

sudo apt update

Run the following command to install Git:

sudo apt install git

Verify the installation by typing the following command which will print the Git version:

git --version

First, install the dependencies necessary to build Git on your Ubuntu system:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install make libssl-dev libghc-zlib-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext unzip

Once the installation is complete open your browser, visit the Git projectâ€™s mirror on GitHub and copy the latest release link URL that ends in .tar.gz:

We are going to download Git source in the /usr/src directory which is the common location to place source files, change to the directory with:

cd /usr/src/
Copy
Download the file as git.tar.gz using the link you copied earlier:

sudo wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.23.0.tar.gz -O git.tar.gz
Copy
Next, extract the tar.gz file and change to the Git source directory by typing:

sudo tar -xf git.tar.gz
cd git-*
CopyCopy
Run the following two commands to compile and install Git on your Ubuntu system:

sudo make prefix=/usr/local all
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
CopyCopy
To verify the installation type the following command which will print the installed Git version:

git --version
Copy
git version 2.23.0
Copy
If you want to upgrade to a newer version, you will need to repeat the installation process.

Configuring Git
Now that you have git installed, it is a good idea to set up your personal information that will be used when you commit your code.

The following commands will set your git commit username and email address:

git config --global user.name "keerthi"
git config --global user.email "keerthikumarjk55gmail.com"
CopyCopy
To verify the configuration changes, type:

git config --list
Copy
The output should look something like this:

user.name=Your Name
user.email=youremail@yourdomain.com
Copy
The configuration settings are stored in the ~/.gitconfig file:

~/.gitconfig
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = youremail@yourdomain.com
