-> Symbolic values
-> Octal values

Read = 4
Write = 2
Exe  = 1

Umask value

The default value of file is 666
The default value of dir is 777

umask

Text file ===> -rw-rw-r--
  4+2 = 6
 
  666
 -664
-------
= 002 ---> The umask value of text file.


Dir ==> drwxrwxr-x
          4+2+1 = 7
  777
 -775
-------
= 002 ---> The umask value of text dir.

SUID (Set user ID)---> Set user id is 4

If SUID bit is set on a file and a user executed it. The process will have the same rights as the owner of the file being executed.


SGID (Set group ID) ---> Set group id is 2
Same as SUID, The process will have the same group rights of the file being executed. 
If SGID bit is set on any directory, all subdirectories and files created inside will get the same group ownership as the main directory, 
it doesnâ€™t matter who is creating.


Sticky bit ---> Sticky bit id is 1
To assign the file permission or dir permission so that other user or except owner can't delete the file or folder accidentally.
The Sticky bit will prevent to delete other ownership files from the other users.
