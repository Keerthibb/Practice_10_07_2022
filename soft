Soft link and Hard Link

1)Master block /Boot block
2)Super block
3)Inode block
4)Data block

Inode block : the inode will keep all the information about your files and directories so when your files is located exactly on the hard drive.

Hard link :-> Not able to find the original file bcz the inode value is same to hard linked files (same inode values for original file and linked file)
              We cannot differenciate the original file and linked file.

To created the hard link : ln (existed filename)  (newly creating file)
    
Soft link :-> We can able to findout the original file and linked file using inode values.

To created the soft link : ln -s (existed filename)  (newly creating file)        

To check the inode values and status, where it is lnked to where. so we have to use stat command

 stat compress  (compress is the filename)
  File: compress -> Compress and update the archive fie.txt
