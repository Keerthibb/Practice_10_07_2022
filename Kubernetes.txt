Container : It is a light weight application
Using system resources we can install container engine and run a container

VM : It is a heavy weight
Have to allocate resources(like CPU,Memory,Disk)

App + Dependcies = Container{It will run on the container engine}

Every container will host on "Docker"

Kubernates is also called "K8S"{Greek work}

Containers will be managed by Kubernates

Container is a open source platform for managing containerised work loads and services.

Kubernates is used for orchestration of containers
